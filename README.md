**🌫️ Air Quality Report - Power BI Dashboard**
This interactive Power BI dashboard provides meaningful insights into air quality indicators across various cities in India. It uses a combination of modern, visually appealing charts to transform raw air pollution data into actionable information for decision-making and awareness.

**📊 Dashboard Overview**
_KPIs Displayed:_
+ Average CO levels
+ Average NO levels
+ Average SO2 levels
+ Average PM2.5 levels
+ Last Refresh Date
  
**Visuals Included:**
+ Least Polluted Cities (bar chart)
+ Top 3 Polluted Cities (bar chart)
+ AQI Trend Over Time (line chart)
+ Geographical AQI overview (map visualization)
  

**🛠️ Features and Visual Storytelling
Comparison Visuals:**
